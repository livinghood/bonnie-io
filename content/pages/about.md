Summary: A crafter of all the beautiful things


I'm Bonnie Chan and living with my husband Kristoffer and 4 cats   in Sweden. 

When I don't sit in front of my computers, I usually spend time planning the next big knitting or crocheting projects. 

As my knitting and crocheting skills fare better than my programming, I often talk about programming in knitting and crocheting terms. 

In case of potential correspondence, it can be done in English, Chinese and Swedish.
