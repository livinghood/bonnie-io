Summary: A crafter of all the beautiful things


![Me and Sunsun]({filename}/images/head.jpg){: style="float:left"}
I'm Bonnie Chan. I have recently graduated from University of Bor√•s with a degree in Informatics (Systemvetenskap in Swedish).   <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> If one is not enough, I also have a degree in Media Technology and Creative Media from School of Creative Media in Hong Kong.

I live with [Kristoffer](http://kri.gs/) and 4 cats in Sweden. 

When I'm not sitting in front of computers, I spend time on planning the next big knitting or crocheting projects or  watching slow films.

At times, I draw a rare but beautiful connection between knitting/crocheting and programming for they share plenty of characteristics and demand equal amount of skills and dedication from me. 

## About this site
This is my web fortress where I keep notes, stories and inspirations. The primary idea is to keep a documentation of what I learn and do with a focus on web technology, user experience and QA. When I feel a need to motivate myself, I retreat to this, organise my ideas and keep them in a folder.
