The last time I had a personal homepage or a blog was probably 10 years ago. It was the time when Wordpress catered mainly for personal blogs and people started moving away from handcrafting their sites in Notepad. 

## Why now?

Pelican now comes with a quickstart command similar to Sphinx which will setup the recommended folder structure for you. When running the `command`, I think I answered all questions with their default answers.

	:::python
	s = "Python syntax highlighting"
	print s

## ... and why Pelican?
There are numerous [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) available. 
It supports Markdown which I have been using for a couple of years. I wrote all my papers and even thesis drafts in it. 
Thorough documentation
More support if I run into problems


	:::sh
	sudo apt-get install python3-pip
