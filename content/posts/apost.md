The last time I had a personal homepage or a blog was probably 10 years ago. It was the time when Wordpress catered mainly for personal blogs and people started moving away from handcrafting their sites in Notepad or simply Livejournal. 

## Why now?
Learning new things requires all senses of mine but I learn the most by writing things down. Say I'm a system, the inputs of information come from a multitude of senses - sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. When I perceive the data and make sense out of it, I internalise and learn it by writing things down. Having a place to retreat to helps. This little dwelling will hopefully serve its purpose. 

Since I submitted my thesis, I've been learning arguably too many things at once. Suddenly all cards on my Trello board ended up under **Done**. Despite having a sense of temporary emptiness, I filled out more cards and stacked them under **To-do** & **To-learn** like this:

| To-do           | To-learn++     | 
|:----------------|:---------------| 
| **Find a job!**    | Python         |        
| Sleep a lot	     | shell/bash     |           
| Play with catz  | HTML5CSSJS     | 
| Roll some catz  | BI jazz        |    

Amazing news is that I've pretty much been doing what I planned to do - making some marinated Python with a drizzle of Git and finishing with a few strings of cat hair. Well, you get the idea! Now is the time to practice all the jazz and document all the finess. 

## ... and why Pelican?

Similar to any projects, I as a user and a project manager have some ideas and requirements when it comes to what I want and achieve. My requirement list is shyly short.

* Plenty to learn.
* Something in Python would be nice.
* Simple and flexible when it comes to designing and editing.
* Can host on Github.

My search led me to research more on [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/). There is plenty of them available but only a handful is written in Python. Wait, why would you want a static site? Because a dynamic CMS like Wordpress would overkill. Take a look at this site, it contain maybe at most 5 pages. It doesn't require a database to render what I'm planning to do here. Since I've been playing with Pelican, I have discovered more benefits -

* Supports Markdown which I have been using for a couple of years. I wrote all my papers and even thesis drafts in it. It shifts the focus from configuring endless options to pure writing. I can now write in my preferred editor and just float aloft. 
* It is fast! A set of static files (HTML, CSS & JS) loads faster than a dynamically generated site with all cache and database. 
* Extensive documentation. You only need to read *carefully* if you run into any problems. 
* Pelican fulfills every point in my requirement list. Can it be possible?

That sounds too good to be true. Yes, indeed. But tales of long-hour frustration will come in the next post combined with a lesson-learnt guide to Pelican. Until then, I give you some links found when I prepared this post.
